* debugging tools: use iterators to create resumable function
* generic implementation for circulators of all kind
** easy writing of own "circulators"

* consistent naming for walker edgeRef etc.
** Walker is not a good name, Probably EdgeRef
** Walker 
* does it make sense that the halfedge a vertex points to, does not point back?
* should procs be generated, that can't be called, but with documentation about what went wrong
* test for vec3 dvec3 vec4 dvec4 as normal and point
* should point property be renamed to poisition?
* introduce normalize_or_z as a fallback for the case that the input might be zero
* int argument for pow function in math
